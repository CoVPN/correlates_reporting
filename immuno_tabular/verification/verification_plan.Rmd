## Verification Procedure

Verification for the immunogenicity tables generated in support of the CoVPN correlates reporting will be a complete independent verification. This means that every table will be verified through independent double programming. A table will be verified by someone other than the original programmer (the tester). 

For independent double programming, the tester will independently generate the same table based on the tables specification. They will then programmatically verify the values presented in the original table match the ones generated by the verification code, and produce an output file that shows that the results match. 

Mock data used in the verification can be found in the `COVIDcorr` R package, available at https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_mockdata. Any use of this code outside of the mock data is not guaranteed and is subject to additional verification.

### Verification Assignments

The verification results will be contained in `verification_results.pdf`, where the results of the independent verification will be reported. It will contain a table that lists the table generated, the original source code filename, the verification code filename, the results of the comparison, and the date the testing is completed.
