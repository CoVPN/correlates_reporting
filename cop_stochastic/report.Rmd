We estimate the counterfactual mean of symptomatic COVID-19 infection under
posited shifts in the measured activity levels of each of four CoP biomarkers.
By shifting the _standardized_ CoP biomarker activity levels by standard units
$\{-0.5, -0.4, \ldots, 0.4, 0.5\}$, we can assess the degree to which vaccines
that possibly enhance the CoP biomarker activity to these levels could mitigate
COVID-19 infection in terms of counterfactual risk.
