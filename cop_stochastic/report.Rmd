# CoP: Stochastic Interventional Effects on Risk and Vaccine Efficacy {#cop-stochastic}

Using an approach recently advocated by @hejazi2020efficient, we estimate the
counterfactual mean of symptomatic COVID-19 infection under posited shifts in
the measured activity levels of each of four CoP biomarkers.  By shifting the
_standardized_ CoP biomarker activity levels by standard units $\{-0.5, -0.4,
\ldots, 0.4, 0.5\}$, we can assess the degree to which vaccines that possibly
enhance the CoP biomarker activity to these levels could mitigate COVID-19
infection in terms of counterfactual risk.

      in RBD binding antibody activity levels. Projection of the dose-response
      curve onto a linear working model provides evidence of decreased expected
      infection risk with increases in RBD binding antibody activity.}

      expected infection risk with increases in spike protein antibody activity,
      though the trend flattens sharply beyond negative shifts.}

      dose-response curve onto a linear working model provides no evidence of

      virus-neutralizing antibody activity.}

      antibody activity.}
