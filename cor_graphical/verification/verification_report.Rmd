## Description

This is the verification report for the `cor_graphical` folder of the `correlates_reporting` project for CoVPN. 

In the verification process, the output of `cor_graphical_verification_code.R` is compared against the plots listed in the the folder `immuno_graphical/verification/verification_input`. The values presented in the original plot against the ones generated by the verification code. Any statistical calculations will either be verified by computing them to a verified statistical table , or they will be generated independently.

The files `cor_graphical/verification/verification_input/practice_data.csv`, `cor_graphical/verification/verification_input/longer_cor_data_plot1.rds` and 
`cor_graphical/verification/verification_input/plot.25sample1.rds` was provided by the original programmer to the tester for verification purposes.
