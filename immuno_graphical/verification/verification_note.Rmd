####Figure 1.3 Pair plots of D57 Ab markers: baseline negative vaccine arm
Scatter plots and density plots have been validated by independent programming.
The verification for partial Spearman's rank correlation calculation is pending. 

####Figure 1.24; RCDF plots for D57 Ab markers: by baseline status for the vaccine arm.
Key statistics(0th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 100th percentile) have been validated by independent programming.
The verification for RCDF curves is pending. 

####Figure 1.32; Boxplots of D57 Ab markers: baseline negative vaccine + placebo arms
Boxplots have been validated by independent programming.

####Figure 1.47; Spaghetti plots of Ab markers over time: baseline negative vaccine + placebo arm
Key statistics(min, 25th percentile, median, mean, 75th percentile, max) have been validated by independent programming.
