# Specifications for CoR_COXPH

There are two main sets of results in the CoR_COXPH section of the report: (i) Cox regression model coefficients, and (ii) marginalized risk curves based on Cox models. 

The population of interest for the D57 CoR study is defined as baseline negative, per-protocol, at risk at 7 days post the Day 57 visit. We are for the most part interested in the vaccine arm, but the placebo arm is sometimes also of interest as a comparison.

## Cox regression model coefficients

Due to the two-phase sampling design, the survey package svycoxph function (using twophase function to create the design object) will be used for fitting Cox models and getting confidence intervals and P values. 

Four biomarkers will be studied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Day57bindSpike
    \item Day57bindRBD
    \item Day57pseudoneutid50
    \item Day57pseudoneutid80.
\end{itemize}
Their trichotomized version adds cat at the end, e.g. Day57bindSpikecat.

Cox regression models are fit to both the baseline negative, vaccinee population (defined in more details above) and subgroups therein. All models adjust for the following baseline covariates: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item at risk or not
    \item community of color or not
\end{itemize}


\clearpage

The following two tables contain results to be verified, one for the continuous markers and the other for the trichotomized markers.

$\ast\ast$ No. at-risk = number of per-protocol baseline negative vaccine recipients at-risk for COVID at 7 days post Day 57 visit; no. cases = number of this cohort with an observed COVID endpoints. The No. at-risk in the trichotomized table are weighted estimates based on the phase 2 samples.

$\ast\ast\ast$ Generalized Wald-test p-value of the null hypothesis that the hazard rate is constant across the Lower, Middle, and Upper tertile groups.

The q-values and FWER are computed using Sue Li's implementation of the Westfall and Young permutation-based method (kyotil::p.adj.perm) for the continuous and trichotomized markers together. We verify Sue's implementation through a Monte Carlo study that is outside of this verification plan.


\bigskip

For each of the continuous markers, we also fit the Cox model for the following subgroups. Note that we cannot adjust for all baseline demographic variables in all cases.
\begin{itemize}
    \item age >= 65
    \item age<65 and at risk
    \item age<65 and not at risk
    \item at risk
    \item Not at risk
    \item Comm of color
    \item White non-Hispanic
    \item Men
    \item Women
\end{itemize}



## Marginalized risk

The primary implementation of marginalized risk uses functions from the package marginalizedRisk on CRAN. The marginalizedRisk package is written for a more general purpose. The verification will double program the specific algorithm used to compute the marginalized risk in this report.
